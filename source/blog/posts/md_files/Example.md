This is an example post demonstrating the capabilities of the `BPG.py` Python script.

Above was inline code, here is *italics* and **bold**. Here's some C code, as well.

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, world!");

    return 0;
}
```

Lastly, here is some inline LaTeX: $\int 3x^2 \, dx = x^3 + C$, as well as some blocked LaTeX:

$$\int 3x^2 \, dx = x^3 + C$$

Thank you for viewing this example file.
